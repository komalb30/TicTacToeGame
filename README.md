# TicTacToeGame
In the Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation, I've used:

・2D Arrays to represent the game board

・Loops to iterate over the board and check for wins

・Conditional Statements to check for valid moves and wins

・Methods to organize the code and perform specific tasks

・Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance
